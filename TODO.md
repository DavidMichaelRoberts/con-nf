- Remove excessive imports.
- Clean up instances to take advantage of Lean 4.
- Exploit `erw` where possible.
- Fix variable letters.
- Add typeclasses for derivatives and toStructPerm?
- Unify naming of `comp`/`derivative`/`lower`.
- Add documentation.
- Move all the things of the form `_root_.*`
- Clarify that `@[simp]` lemmas normalise casts between permutation types to be visible to help with applying lemmas. (Change them to coercions, and then we won't need this maybe?)
- Remove instance names.
- Rename `AllowablePerm` to `NewAllowable`; rename all of the `Allowable`/`NearLitterPerm`/`StructPerm` objects?
- Remove double line breaks.
- Reformat lines containing only `by`.
- Change `refine'` to new variants.
